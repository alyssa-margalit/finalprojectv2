potentiometer values:
  
How it works:
  Run vm.py on your vm and run pi3.py on your rpi
  Spin the potentiometer in any direction to "wake" the dragon
  The dragon will ask you who you are
    the options are wizard, hero, villain or peasant
  Respond by turning the potentiometer with sword to the desired value as written on the rocks
  click button to lock in potentiometer response
  The dragon will then ask if you've come for the treasure
  Turn the potentiometer and click the button to respond
  The dragon will then ask you a trivia question depending on your previous response. 
  
  There are three different story paths:
    1. you have come for the treasure and you answer the trivia question correctly in which case you get the "treasure"
    2. you have come for the treasure and you answer the trivia question incorrectly in which case you are "cursed"
    3. you have not come for the treasure in which case you are "banished"
